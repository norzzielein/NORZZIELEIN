    <div align = "justify">
    My mind is a realm of endless exploration where <strong> Introverted Intuition </strong> fuels my quest for understanding. Like a detective piecing clues together, I delve into the depths of Data Science and Mathematics to uncover patterns that reveal the hidden truths of our physical world. Drawing inspiration from the enigmatic mystery plots of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle, I approach each problem with a sense of introspective curiosity to unmask the secrets that lie beneath the surface. My intuitive nature underscores my conviction that even the most unlikely solutions can unveil the hidden realities in the realm of the improbable once the impossible is dismissed.
